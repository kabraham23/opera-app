                    <h1>About Katie</h1>
                    <p>A daughter of two musicians, music has always been a major influence in Katie Abraham's life. She started Suzuki, at age 4, with a violin crafted from a cereal box and ruler. From her orchestral training came a love of chamber music and an appreciation for great musicianship. Her transition to opera came from a love of singing, theater, lush orchestra, and collaborating with others.</p>
                    <h4>Performing with determination, grace, and joy.</h4>
                    <p>Katie has a Bachelors of Music in Voice Performance from The Chicago College of Performing Arts at Roosevelt University, and a Masters of Music in Voice Performance from Mannes College - The New School for Music studying. During that time, she has performed roles in The Dialogues of the Carmelites, Les contes d'Hoffmann, The Pirates of Penzance, Hin und zurück, and Gianni Schicchi. Her major scenes have been from Der Rosenkavalier, Das Rheingold, Peter Grimes, and Le nozze di Figaro. She has also performed world premieres by talented young composers in Chicago and New York.</p>
                    <p>Katie graduated from The Boston Conservatory with a Graduate Performance Diploma in Opera. Her time at the Conservatory lead her to sing Female Chorus in The Rape of Lucretia, Lišak (Fox) in Příhody lišky Bystroušky (The Cunning Little Vixen), and Eleanor of Aquitaine in Carlysle Floyd's Flower and Hawk - being acclaimed as "a compelling tour de force".</p>
                    <p>Katie takes great pride in her recital work. She has been selected for prestigious recitals, working with Ken Merrill on the Ariettes Oubliées by Claude Debussy, Schubert's Auf dem Strom with Victor Rosenbaum and various French mélodie with Christina Stanescu. She has found success in competitions - winning second place in The Boston Conservatory's concerto competition singing Strauss's Vier Letzte Lieder and being awarded an encouragement award at the Kansas City District Metropolitan Opera National Council Auditions. </p>
